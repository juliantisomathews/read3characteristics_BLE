# read3characteristics_BLE

A Bluetooth LE application that reads and iterates over three characteristics (sensor readings) and writes them to a webpage. For this example, it reads temperature, humidity, and turbidity from two different sensors: a DHT 22 temperature/humidity sensor and a SKU SEN0189 turbidity sensor. This was built off of a boiler plate from Tom Igoe.
